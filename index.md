Yes [wau](https://crouton.net) ![nyawr](https://crouton.net/crouton.png "croot on") this is a webpage with several text on it.
It is continuing to be a webpage. I dunno what I'm going to put here in the future; I already have a neocities and I'm making this

to figure out how to deal with GitHub Pages and GitHub's own very special unique Markdown flavor before trying to do any of that.

only one way to find out
